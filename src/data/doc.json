We built 3 dictionaries: one to flag feminine gendered lyrics like “women”, “girl”, “her”, and “she”; one to flag masculine gendered lyrics like “man”, “boy”, “his”, and “he”; and one to flag relationship lyrics like “love”, “heart”, “kiss”, “sex”."},{"type":"text","value":"We used lyrics from an existing corpus and filled in gaps from <a href=https://genius.com/ target=_blank>Genius</a>.

From there we listened to A LOT of music to identify the 8 songs with explicit same-gender relationship lyrics. Think we missed anything?
